1. Add some exceptions to be more specific (instead of just raising an Exception)
2. Add 180 spins
3. Add a level display
4. Add a menu to allow modifications directly after launching the program instead of modifying it inside of the file
5. Add an attack system along with multiplayer (2-4 players mostly because there aren't enough buttons to handle more on a keyboard)
