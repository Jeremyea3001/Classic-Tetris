1. Add a next piece queue
2. Separate the main loop into multiple different functions to prevent code repetitions
3. Add 180 spins
4. Add a menu to allow modifications directly after launching the program instead of modifying it inside of the file
5. Add a level display
6. Add an attack system along with multiplayer (2-4 players mostly because there aren't enough buttons to handle more on a keyboard)
